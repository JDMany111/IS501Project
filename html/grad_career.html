                            meetinghouse and facilities department doing anyalytics for them. This has been a great experience as I have had several

                        <p class="lead times">I want to work my way up through IT/IS to a director or VP role and try starting my own business doing

                        <h2>Experience</h2>
                        <p class="lead times">So far my experience in this are has come from my job before the MBA, my internship, and my classes.
                            When I worked at UCCU, I had access to the VISA Data Manager and was able to create and retrieve reports for anything related to member's 
                            use of their cards. This was a graphical interface but was good experience working with creating reports. My internship has with the Church
                            has given me the chance to automate several projects using the selenium basic addon for VBA where I was able to get thousands of rows of results in 
                            hours instead of days.</p> 
                            
                        <p class="lead times">I have taken a variety of courses including the Database Analysis and Design, Advanced Strategy Analytics, Spreadsheet Automation,
                            Advanced Spreadsheets for Business Analysis, and Intro to IS that have given me an indepth knowlege of excel, VBA, and SQL along with a decent knowlege of 
                            HTML, CSS, R, Python, Tableau, Alteryx, and Oracle Apex.</p>

                        <p class="lead times">Below is a picture example of a dashboard I built in Tableau</p>

                        <p class="lead times">Currently, I dont know exactly what I will contribute to the companies I work for or the industry,
                         but the main idea I have is that because I have a decent understanding of both the techincal side of analytics 
                         and information systems and the business side of accounting, pricing, strategy, quality management, etc., I think 
                         I can be a good leader/coordinator to make sure projects are moving forward properly and everyone understands what is going on.
                          I think I will be able to provide valuable insights about how to solve business problems because I am able to both understand 
                          things from a technical analyst side and a business side.
