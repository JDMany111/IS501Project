    <p class="big">Understanding personal finance is a useful skill for anyone to have. Over the past several years, I have developed a lot
     of interest in the subject. Personal finance can involve lots of areas, but here I am only going to cover 3.
     I am not a certified financial planner, so make sure to do your own research before relying on any information listed here</p>
    
    <h3 id="debt">Debt</h3>
    
    <p>Debt can be a tool to use in creating wealth, but can also pose an obstacle to gaining it</p>
    <p>Here are some things to consider when thinking about debt:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are the loan terms. What is the interest rate on the loan? How long is it for? Can it be paid off early without a penalty?</li>
        <li>Will this help my life be better in the long term? Can I perform some type of mathmatical calculation showing this should return more than it costs?</li>
        <li>How much risk does this put me in? The more leverage/debt you have, the more dependent you are on circumstances staying normal. If you lose your job or have an emergency, can you still meet your obligations?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This chart shows some interesting trends with debt in the U.S.</p>

    <h3 id="taxes">Taxes</h3>
    <p>Most people dislike how much they pay in taxes, and there are strategies that can be helpful in legally lowering the amount you pay</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Standard vs itemized deduction
            <ol>Knowing when it makes sense to choose each one can be helpful
                <li>Standard deductions make sense for most people since they are larger than most peoples itemized deductions</li>
                <li>Higher income earners can strategically make itemized deduction eligible expenses like chartiable donations all in the same year to increase the deduction that year and use a standard deduction other years</li>
                <li>Some expenses like income tax, property tax, or sales tax can be added to itemized deductions</li>
            </ol>           
        </li>
        <li>Regular deductions
            <ol>Some things can be deducted or excluded from income
                <li>If you contribute to a traditional IRA, 401K or 403b, the amount contributed up to the maximum amount for the year is deducted from your federally taxable income in that year</li>
                <li>Contributing to an HSA can be either excluded or deducted from income in the current year and in the future if used for medical purposes</li>
                <li>Contributions to a Roth IRA, 401K, or 403b are taxable in the current year, but when you take the money out all the growth it has accumulated cannot be taxed as long as it meets the age and time requirements</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Capital Gains
            <ol>Not all income is taxed the same
                <li>If you invest money in stocks for more than one year then sell them and make money, this can usually be considered a long term capital gain which has a lower tax rate than the rest of your income</li>
                <li>When you lend the government money through bills, notes, or bonds, the interest you earn from them is non-taxable by other government entities. Federal treasuries are not taxed by states, and state and local bonds are not taxed by the federal government</li>
                <li>Dividends earned on eligible long term capital gains stocks that have not been sold can also be taxed at the lower long term capital gains rate</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="savings_rate">Savings Rate</h3>
    <p>Most people dont become wealthy from gaining a huge amount of money at a single time. Instead they do it over time</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your savings rate is the percentage of your income you save every year. The larger your savings rate, the better you will be prepared for retirement</li>
        <li>Diversifying your investments through ETFs or Mutual Funds is wise for most people since these reduce the risk of catestrophic losses from a company going out of business</li>
        <li>Keeping lifestyle creep under control is critical to long term financial success as there will always be more nice things you could have or spend money on</li>
    </ul>
